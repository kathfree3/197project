MS1
- A user can register for an account/ login
- When a user signs up they can either create a new house to join, or join an existing one as long as they have the associated password 
- once logged in a user can view chores for their house or create new ones
- made a button for if a chore is completed or not so it disapears from the current chores section
- basic laundry set up
  - can register new machines and they can only be of type washer or dryer
  - can start a load, view how much time is left on a load, and "take the load out" 
  - used a packaged called motion to manipulate the timestamp/ date fields on the laundry


Still need to do
- if a chore is unassigned, have a way to modify it to assign it to someone/ if you want to unclaim a chore you should be able to as well
- not really a lot of error checking right now its pretty messy so i need to set that up
- the nav bar is kind of messy/ need to clean that up
- incorporate NextJS
- more styling
- should only be able to access certain pages if you are logged in/ logged out

Not sure if the readme should have been more formal and detailed but this is basically what i have done so far!
